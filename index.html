                                    I went into consulting because I wanted to see how the rest of the world works.

I helped them build custom applications ranging from publishing tools, to billing systems, to molecular simulators. In return, they showed me how great teams operate.

                                    BGI is where I really cut my teeth as a software engineer. I wrestled with some of the ugliest, most broken, yet most profitable software you've ever seen -- over 500k lines of code running more that $50 billion in assets. Over time, we all learned what "quality" really means and how to achieve it. It was a difficult journey at times, but it taught me how to balance business goals with engineering principles.

                                    Wink was my gateway into the dot-com boom. When I started, I knew <i>just enough</i> about programming to be useful. And then I began learning new technologies while building interactive television applications. It was all very cutting-edge stuff then, and it was exciting to see your own application pop up on the TV screen in a hotel lobby or bar.

                                    Much of modern software development involves assembling applications from various open source components. Pinto is a component management tool for Perl that ensures your applications are consistently built with the correct libraries and frameworks.  At the same time, Pinto has powerful features that help you safely upgrade and test components.  Pinto is the heart of <a href="https://stratopan.com">Stratopan</a> and is used by numerous organizations with large and complex Perl codebases.

                                    While working at BGI, we wanted to improve our code quality without sinking a lot of time into training or code reviews. This inspired me to create Perl-Critic, the leading static analyzer for Perl. Perl-Critic automatically detects bugs, finds security holes, and enforces best-practices on millions of lines of Perl code. Perl-Critic is now used by thousands of organizations every day to help them produce more reliable, secure, and maintainable code.

                                    From time to time, I teach classes on programming with Perl. As they say, the best way to really master a subject is to teach it, and sometimes I feel that I learn more from the class than my students. I teach at all levels, but the introductory classes are the most challenging and the most rewarding for me.
